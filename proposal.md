#Title - Art break timer
#Repository - https://github.com/hanson0809/Proposal-Final-Project.git 
#Discription - Bascially I have not been healthy about having breaks when I make art! I am sure I am not the only one with this issue. I lose track of time and do not take enough breaks. I want to make a timer to remind artists to take breaks from creating! 
#Features - It will be intervals of 20 mins for a 5 min break to grab a snack strech or relax. It will open a window and flash colors for when you should take a break. There should be a timer for when the break starts. When the break is over the flashing colors go away and you can return making artwork.
#Challenges - I am going to need to learn how to make colors rotate continuously.
#Outcomes - 
#a. Timer appears acurate numbers and accurate time with rotating colors.
#b. Just a basic timer to take breaks. It is just a tool to remind the artist to take a break
#Milestones - 
Week 1 - get the timer to work
Week 2 - get the timer to show and understand rotating colors
Week 3 - create a popup window with correct timings for the numbers to show accurately
