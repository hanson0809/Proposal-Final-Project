# Proposal-Final-Project

"I read the commet about making my proposal more complex and decided to create a break timer after the 20 mins is up. During the break timer music will be played and hand stretch images will rotate every min until the 5 min timer is up. Once the timer is up you can restart the 20 min interval etc. I am very proud of making this because it was confusing importing downloaded files and music.
